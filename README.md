# GravityBall

[**GravityBall**](http://timsunpang.github.io/GravityBall/) is a fun, simple game in which you use physics to maneuver a ball to
a goal point without touching any walls. It gets increasingly difficult, however,
as after each stage, an obstacle is randomly added to the screen. See how far
you can get without losing 5 times!
